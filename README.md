# E7012E-Mechatronics: Team Line Riders
This repository contains work done for the course E7012E - Mechatronics at LTU Spring 2019



## The Project
The task is to build an automated guided vehicle or AGV. The vehicle should be able to follow along a line track without deviating and within a set time.

### The Team
![The team.](https://github.com/zachtyll/E7012E-Mechatronics/blob/master/Team%208%20-%20Line%20Rider.JPG)
The team consists of Julius Lundberg, Jonathan Myrsell, Ivar Rockström, Alejandro Salvador, Anton Sundström and Zacharias Tyllström. 

### The AGV
The tasks the team were set out to solve were to design and construct a
- [x] Line sensor using the ITR20001-T photo transistor
- [x] Hall sensor using the Hall Effect sensor SS441A, TO-92
- [x] Control a steering servo using PID
- [x] Control a DC motor using PID


## Cheat sheet for git
